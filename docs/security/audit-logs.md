# Audit Logs

Audit logs record who performed an authentication action, who or what it affected, when it happened, and the available request context. Own Auth writes these events automatically as part of each supported operation.

## Audit event fields

Each `AuditEvent` contains:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique event ID. |
| `eventType` | One of the recorded event names above. |
| `actorUserId` | The user who performed the action, when known. |
| `targetUserId` | The user affected by the action, when known. |
| `organisationId` | The related organisation, when applicable. |
| `apiKeyId` | The related API-key record, when applicable. |
| `ipAddress` | Request IP address when supplied through `request`. |
| `userAgent` | User-Agent value when supplied through `request`. |
| `metadata` | Event-specific structured data. |
| `createdAt` | The time the event was written. |

## Query audit logs

Use `listAuditEvents`. Results are returned as an array with the newest events first.

```ts
const events = await auth.listAuditEvents({
  actorUserId: currentUser.id,
});
```

Filter by API key:

```ts
const events = await auth.listAuditEvents({
  actorUserId: currentUser.id,
  apiKeyId,
});
```

Filters can be combined:

```ts
const events = await auth.listAuditEvents({
  userId,
  organisationId,
  apiKeyId,
  actorUserId: currentUser.id,
});
```

`actorUserId` is required. The available filters are `userId`, `organisationId`, and `apiKeyId`. A user filter matches events where that user is either the actor or the target. Without an organisation filter, users can read only their own events.

`listAuditEvents` does not currently support event-type filters, date ranges, limits, offsets, cursors, or total counts.

### Response

```ts
const [event] = await auth.listAuditEvents({
  actorUserId: currentUser.id,
});

// event -> {
//   id: "evt_...",
//   eventType: "session.created",
//   actorUserId: "usr_...",
//   targetUserId: "usr_...",
//   organisationId: null,
//   apiKeyId: null,
//   ipAddress: "203.0.113.42",
//   userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0...",
//   metadata: { sessionId: "ses_..." },
//   createdAt: Date,
// }
```

## Organisation audit logs

Pass the signed-in user as the actor when loading organisation events:

```ts
const events = await auth.listAuditEvents({
  organisationId,
  actorUserId: currentUser.id,
});
```

Own Auth checks the actor's active membership and `view_audit_events` permission before returning organisation events.

## Request context

Pass request context to auth methods when the audit trail should include an IP address and user agent:

```ts
await auth.signInEmailPassword({
  email,
  password,
  request: {
    ipAddress: req.ip,
    userAgent: req.headers["user-agent"],
  },
});
```

When request context is omitted, `ipAddress` and `userAgent` are stored as `null`.

## Event metadata

Metadata depends on the event:

| Event | Example metadata |
|---|---|
| `session.created` | `{ sessionId: "ses_..." }` |
| `session.revoked` | `{ reason: "user_logout" }` or `{ reason: "user_revoked", sessionId: "ses_..." }` |
| `session.revoked_all` | `{ reason: "password_reset", revoked: 3 }` |
| `user.signed_in` | `{ method: "magic_link" }` or `{ method: "phone_otp" }` when applicable |
| `external_provider.linked` | `{ provider: "google" }` |
| `oauth.started` | `{ provider: "google", intent: "sign_in", mode: "popup" }` |
| `oauth.signed_in` | `{ provider: "google", mode: "redirect" }` |
| `saml.started` | `{ connectionId: "samlc_...", intent: "sign_in" }` |
| `saml.failed` | `{ connectionId: "samlc_...", error: "saml_response_invalid" }` |
| `saml.member_provisioned` | `{ connectionId: "samlc_...", role: "member" }` |
| `scim.user_created` | `{ connectionId: "scimc_...", scimUserId: "scimu_..." }` |
| `scim.user_updated` | `{ connectionId: "scimc_...", scimUserId: "scimu_...", fields: ["displayName"] }` |
| `scim.user_deleted` | `{ connectionId: "scimc_...", scimUserId: "scimu_..." }` |
| `mfa.challenge_succeeded` | `{ method: "totp" }` |
| `session.elevated` | `{ assuranceLevel: "aal2", method: "passkey" }` |
| `passkey.registered` | `{ passkeyId: "psk_...", discoverable: true }` |
| `sms_otp.sent` | `{ purpose: "phone_login", otpId: "otp_..." }` |
| `api_key.created` | `{ name: "Production", scopes: ["reports:read"] }` |
| `api_key.used` | `{ requiredScopes: ["reports:read"] }` |
| `organisation.created` | `{ name: "Acme", slug: "acme" }` |
| `organisation.deleted` | `{ organisationId: "org_...", name: "Acme", slug: "acme", membersRemoved: 3, apiKeysRemoved: 2, invitationsRemoved: 1 }` |
| `member.invited` | `{ email: "bob@example.com", role: "member", invitationId: "inv_..." }` |
| `member.role_changed` | `{ previousRole: "member", role: "owner", ownershipTransferredTo: null }` |
| `member.removed` | `{ memberId: "mem_...", role: "owner", ownershipTransferredTo: "usr_..." }` |

## Secret handling

Audit events do not contain raw OAuth state, One Tap nonces, provider credentials, access or refresh tokens, session tokens, MFA challenge tokens, TOTP secrets, recovery codes, SMS codes, passkey responses, WebAuthn challenges, SAML responses, assertions, subjects, request IDs, relay state, certificates, signing keys, or raw SCIM bearer tokens. Plugin after-hooks receive secret-redacted results, and plugin audit metadata must also exclude secrets.

## Retention

Audit events remain in `own_auth_audit_events` until they are removed. Own Auth does not delete them automatically.

Delete events older than a chosen cutoff:

```ts
const deleted = await auth.cleanupAuditLogs({
  olderThan: new Date("2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"),
});
```

`cleanupAuditLogs` permanently deletes every audit event created before `olderThan` and returns the number deleted.
