# Rate Limiting

Own Auth applies built-in rate limits to sensitive authentication entry points. Core limits do not need middleware or separate configuration.

## Built-in limits

| Operation | Identifier | Default limit | Window |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Sign up | Normalised email | 5 | 10 minutes |
| Password sign in | Normalised email | 10 | 10 minutes |
| Change password | User ID | 5 | 10 minutes |
| Magic-link request | Normalised email | 5 | 10 minutes |
| Email-verification request | Normalised email | 5 | 10 minutes |
| Password-reset request | Normalised email | 5 | 15 minutes |
| SMS-code request | Normalised phone number | 5 | 15 minutes |
| SMS-code verification | Normalised phone number | 10 | 15 minutes |
| Trusted external-provider sign in | Provider account ID | 20 | 10 minutes |
| OAuth start | IP address, when available | 20 | 10 minutes |
| OAuth callback | IP address, when available | 30 | 10 minutes |
| Google One Tap prepare | IP address, when available | 20 | 10 minutes |
| Google One Tap verify | IP address, when available | 30 | 10 minutes |
| API-key creation | User or organisation owner | 20 | 1 hour |
| Organisation invite | Organisation ID | 10 | 1 hour |

These limits reduce password guessing, credential stuffing, repeated email and SMS sends, excessive invitations, and excessive key creation.

SMS codes allow five wrong guesses by default. MFA challenges also allow five failed attempts by default. These per-credential attempt limits are enforced separately from the shared rate-limit store through `sms.maxAttempts` and `mfa.maxAttempts`.

## What happens when a limit is exceeded

Own Auth throws `AuthError` with:

- `code`: `rate_limited`
- `statusCode`: `429`
- `safeMessage`: `Too many attempts. Try again later.`

```ts
import { AuthError } from "own-auth";

try {
  await auth.signInEmailPassword({ email, password });
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof AuthError && error.code === "rate_limited") {
    return res.status(error.statusCode).json({
      error: error.safeMessage,
    });
  }

  throw error;
}
```

`AuthError` does not currently include a `retryAfterMs` value. Do not read or document that field unless the public error contract adds it.

## Default durable store

With the default Postgres setup, Own Auth stores counters in `own_auth_rate_limits` in the same database as the auth data. The Cloudflare D1 adapter uses the same table in D1.

The counters survive server restarts and are shared by every application instance connected to that database. No additional rate-limit configuration is needed for the default setup.

```ts
const auth = createOwnAuth({
  tokenPepper: process.env.OWN_AUTH_TOKEN_PEPPER,
});
```

## Configuration

The built-in core operation limits and windows are not configurable. Plugins may declare their own namespaced endpoint rate limits, but cannot replace or weaken core limits.

## Next step

Set up [Audit logs](/docs/audit-logs) to track auth events, or review the full [Security model](/docs/security-model).
