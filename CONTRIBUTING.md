# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Own Auth.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

The API server requires Postgres:

```bash
createdb own_auth_dev
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://localhost:5432/own_auth_dev
psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f packages/core/migrations/001_initial.sql
pnpm dev
```

## Tests

Run everything:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run the real Postgres integration test:

```bash
createdb own_auth_test
pnpm --filter own-auth test:integration
```

The integration test uses `OWN_AUTH_TEST_DATABASE_URL` first, then `DATABASE_URL`, then `postgres://localhost:5432/own_auth_test`.

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes small and focused.
- Add or update tests for auth behavior, storage behavior, or security-sensitive changes.
- Keep runtime storage durable. The API should require Postgres through `DATABASE_URL`.
- Do not commit secrets, `.env` files, or generated local databases.

## Security Contributions

Do not open a public issue or pull request for an undisclosed vulnerability. Use
the private process in [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability).
Security fixes should include regression coverage for the failure mode and should
check related authentication flows for the same vulnerability class.

Maintainers should use the private GitHub advisory workspace until disclosure,
keep private vulnerability reporting enabled for the repository, and follow the
security release process in `SECURITY.md`.

## Release

Releases are maintainer operations. Prepare the release before publishing:

1. Set the same version in `package.json` and `packages/core/package.json`.
2. Add the matching base-version section to `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit and push the release commit to `main`.
4. Make sure the working tree is clean and local `main` matches `origin/main`.

Stable versions use the `x.y.z` format and npm's `latest` tag:

```bash
pnpm release:stable
```

Prereleases use the `x.y.z-next.n` format and npm's `next` tag:

```bash
pnpm release:next
```

Both commands:

1. validate the channel, versions, changelog, branch, npm version, and Git tags
2. run the complete `release:check` suite
3. publish from `packages/core` with npm browser authentication
4. verify the exact npm version and dist-tag
5. create and push the matching annotated Git tag

A prerelease fails if publishing it changes npm's `latest` tag. npm package
versions cannot be overwritten.

### Release Recovery

If npm publishing succeeds but registry verification or Git tagging is interrupted,
do not publish the version again. Verify the published package:

```bash
pnpm release:verify
```

Then create or push the matching Git tag:

```bash
pnpm release:tag
```

The tag command is idempotent when the local and remote tags point to the release
commit. It fails instead of replacing a conflicting tag. Run recovery before moving
local `main` away from the published release commit.
